# library-db

## install
To install you need Python & git installed.

In the directory you want to install, using a command prompt run `git clone https://github.com/EnemigoPython/library-db.git`.

## run
There are no dependencies so you should just be able to run it with no extra steps.

### normal run
To run with the default seed, in the directory run `python main.py`.

### completely random run
To run and get completely random data, run `python main.py -r`.

### seeded run
To get a consistent but random result with a seed, run `python main.py --seed {insert any value}`. The result will be the same every time.
